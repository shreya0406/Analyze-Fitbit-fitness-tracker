# Analyze-Fitbit-fitness-tracker


 Motive
 Analyze Fitbit fitness tracker data to deliver marketing and business solutions to WeFit and its
 subsidiaries
 Company Background
 WeFit was founded by a group of Indian friends, Rohit and Anjali Shah, who were passionate
 about fitness and wanted to create a supportive, welcoming community for people of all fitness
 levels. They started out as a small gym or fitness studio in a bustling city neighborhood, offering
 a variety of classes and training programs that were designed to be inclusive and accessible.
 As the company grew, Rohit and Anjali decided to expand their offerings beyond just in-person
 classes. They started to sell fitness gear, such as weights, exercise machines, and apparel, both
 in-store and online. They also developed their own line of fitness apps, which were designed to
 help users track their workouts, set goals, and connect with other members of the WeFit
 community.
 In addition to physical products and digital tools, WeFit also started to offer customized diet
 plans, created by a team of nutritionists and dietitians. These plans were tailored to the specific
 needs and goals of each customer, and could be integrated into their overall fitness routine. The
 company also developed its own line of meal replacement products to be used as part of the diet
 plans.
 As WeFit's online presence grew, the company started to offer virtual classes and training
 programs that could be accessed through their apps or website. These offerings became
 particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people were unable to attend
 in-person fitness classes.
 Over time, the WeFit brand became known for its high-quality fitness gear, apps, and customized
 diet plans. The company built a loyal following among fitness enthusiasts, who trusted and relied
 on the WeFit brand for all of their fitness needs. WeFit's success and popularity attracted the
 attention of investors, and the company was able to secure funding from venture capitalists to
 help it expand and scale its operations.
 Thanks to its unique approach to fitness, strong brand, and successful business strategies,
 WeFit became a unicorn company, achieving a valuation of over $1 billion. Rohit and Anjali were
 thrilled to have built such a successful business, and they remained committed to their original
 vision of creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all. They continued to innovate
 and expand the company, always striving to help their customers achieve their fitness goals and
 lead healthier, happier lives.
 Business Task
 Use the Fitbit fitness tracker data to determine some smart device usage trends, how customers
 can use them, and how they can affect marketing plans so that the Analytic team of WeFit can
 offer business solutions and add new clients.
Data Used
 The data source used for this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data This dataset was
 downloaded from Kaggle where it was uploaded by Möbius.
 The dataset was made available by Möbius to Kaggle.com under the terms of the CC0: Public
 Domain Creative Common License, which waives all ownership rights in the work and permits
 unrestricted use of the dataset for performance, distribution, and copying. Furberg, Robert,
 Brinton, Julia, Keating, and Ortiz, Alexa were the authors who Möbius cited in relation to the
 Zendo dataset. (See the Source)
 These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical
 Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
 personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep
 monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp
 (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and
 individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
 Business scenario
 There are various business problems to which the Analytic team of WeFit have to provide the
 solution. In this case study we will look at such scenarios and try to provide the solution for these
 problems.
 1. A company called leanfit which is a daughter company of WeFit sells personalized diet
 plans and this company is generating less sales from the last few months and now they
 want the Analytics team to find some potential customers who are most likely to buy their
 personalized diet plans for weight loss.
 As weknow that before purchasing a weight loss diet plan It is a good idea to consult with
 a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or registered dietitian, to ensure that it is safe
 and appropriate for you. It is also important to consider your personal preferences, dietary
 needs, and lifestyle when choosing a diet plan.
 People of all ages, genders, and body types may choose to purchase a weight loss diet
 plan. Some people may decide to purchase a weight loss diet plan because they are
 unhappy with their current weight or because they want to improve their overall health.
 Others may have a specific health condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes,
 that can be improved by losing weight. Some people may also purchase a weight loss
 diet plan as part of a broader effort to improve their physical fitness or to train for a
 specific event, such as a marathon or a bodybuilding competition. In general, anyone who
 is interested in losing weight and improving their health may consider purchasing a weight
 loss diet plan.
 Now we know that If your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the healthy weight range. If
 your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the overweight range. If your BMI is 30.0 or higher,
 it falls within the obesity range.
Weight loss can also help to lower high blood pressure (hypertension). Losing excess
 weight can reduce the strain on your heart and blood vessels, which can help to lower
 your blood pressure. In addition, losing weight can help to improve other factors that
 contribute to high blood pressure, such as high cholesterol levels, insulin resistance, and
 inflammation.
 Elevated heart rate is associated with elevated blood pressure, increased risk for
 hypertension, and, among hypertensives, increased risk for cardiovascular disease.If your
 heart rate exceeds 185 beats per minute during exercise, it is dangerous for you. If you
 have high blood pressure, it is important to work with your healthcare team to develop a
 plan for managing your condition. This may include lifestyle changes, such as following a
 healthy diet and exercising regularly, as well as taking medications as prescribed. Weight
 loss can be an important part of this plan, and it is often recommended for people with
 hypertension.
 Try to find the customers who are likely to buy this weight loss plan, you are given the
 fit-bit fitness tracker data, analyze the data and find some potential customers for leanfit .

 gear online. Some may be individuals who are already very active and looking to upgrade
 or replace their existing gear, while others may be people who are just starting to get into
 fitness and looking for affordable equipment to use at home.
 A person who is already into fitness may be the one wearing the gear for more than 20
 days and recording an average of more than 30 very active minutes. Similarly, if a person

 Sleepy-Nights is a company that is dedicated to helping people get the rest they need to
 feel their best. The company has developed a sleep scheduling app that helps people
 optimize their sleep cycles and get the most out of their time in bed.

 Sleep deprivation is a condition that occurs when you do not get enough sleep or have
 poor quality sleep. It can have serious consequences for your physical and mental health,
 as well as your daily functioning.
 Some common symptoms of sleep deprivation include:
 1. Excessive sleepiness and fatigue during the day
 2. Difficulty concentrating and paying attention
 3. Mood changes, such as irritability or depression
 4. Difficulty remembering things
 5. Decreased ability to perform tasks that require alertness, such as driving or
 operating machinery
Sleep deprivation can have a number of causes, including irregular sleep schedules,
 stress, and certain medical conditions.Spending more time in bed but getting less amount
 of sleep due to other unimportant works is also a reason to cause sleep deprivation.
 It is important to get enough sleep on a regular basis in order to maintain good health and
 well-being. How Much Sleep Is Too Much? Sleep needs can vary from person to person,
 but in general, experts recommend that healthy adults get an average of 7 to 9 hours per
 night of shuteye. If you regularly need more than 8 or 9 hours of sleep per night to feel
 rested, it might be a sign of an underlying problem.If you think you may be sleep
 deprived, it is a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider for further evaluation and
 treatment.
 There is no one specific group of people who are most likely to buy their apps. Some
 people may use these apps to track their sleep patterns, while others may use them to
 set alarms or to get tips for improving their sleep quality. Some common groups of people
 who might use sleep schedule apps include:
 1. People who work irregular shifts or have jet lag
 2. People who are trying to establish a regular sleep schedule
 3. People who are trying to improve their sleep hygiene
 4. People who are trying to improve their overall health and wellness
 Try to find the customers who are likely to buy their subscription, you are given the fit-bit
 fitness tracker data, analyze the data and find some potential customers for
 sleepy-nights.
 4. At last WeFit wants its Analytic team to create a dashboard out of this data to present it in
 front of their management team.
 To do that we will only take the daily activity data and try to create a few charts and
 graphs out of it.
 1. First use the daily activity data and find the unique id of all the users.
 2. Then find the number of days they use their fitness tracker.
 3. Use this data to group all the users into Active(>20), moderate(>10,<20) and
 light(<10) users.
 (for example active user can be the one wearing the gear for more than 20 days)
 4. After that find out the mean distance traveled by each user
 5. Use this mean distance to group each user into Pro,Intermediate and
 beginner.(set criteria by yourself)
 6. Then find out the total steps traveled by each user
 7. Then find out the calories burned by each user
 8. And then find out their fairly active, lightly active and Very active minutes.
 9. Repeat all these tasks (1 to 8) with respect to distinct dates (for example find out
 unique dates instead of unique id and calculate number of users on that date).
 10. Use this filtered data to create charts and graphs for better visualization.
